# Graph

The following section details the endpoints you can use to interact with graph information about the RW API. If you are
new to the RW API or want to learn more about what the RW API graph can do for you, we strongly encourage you to read
the [graph concept documentation](concepts.html#graph) first.

Before proceeding, let's look at some concepts that will be used across the graph endpoint documentation.

## What is a resource

Throughout this section, we'll refer multiple times to `resources`. Simply put, a `resource` is either a dataset, a
widget, a layer, or a metadata entry. Graph nodes represent in a similar fashion these 4 types of RW API entity, so
often we'll refer to resources instead, for convenience.

We assume that, at this point, you are already familiar with the concepts
of [dataset](concepts.html#dataset), [layer](concepts.html#layer), [widget](concepts.html#widget)
or [metadata](concepts.html#metadata) (ideally you are familiar with the 4). If that's not the case, we strongly
encourage you to learn about those concepts first, and we also recommend you take some time to explore and experiment
using actual [dataset](reference.html#dataset), [layer](reference.html#layer), [widget](reference.html#widget),
or [metadata](reference.html#metadata10) endpoints before proceeding. The RW API Graph service builds on top of these
concepts and empowers your use cases of those resources, so it should only be used by applications and users that are
already comfortable with the basics, and want to take their knowledge of the RW API to the next level.

In the context of the RW API Graph service, resources are represented as graph nodes. They can be associated (using
graph edges) with concepts to create relationships of relevance between the two entities.

## What is a concept

Similarly, we'll refer multiple times to `concepts`. A `concept` is a keyword used to describe a resource (
e.g. `health`, `society`, `solar_power`, etc.). It shares some similarities
with [tags](reference.html#vocabularies-and-tags), in the sense it can be associated with resources of different types (
datasets, layers, or widgets).

As with resources, in the context of the RW API Graph service, concepts are represented as graph nodes. They can be
associated (using graph edges) with resources to create relationships of relevance between the two entities.

## Bird's-eye view of the graph service

As an API user, you will surely be glad to hear that most of the management of graph entities is performed
automatically. As you will discover by reading the sections on [creating](reference.html#creating-resources)
or [deleting](reference.html#deleting-resources) graph resources, graph nodes for resources are automatically created
and deleted when you create or delete your resources, respectively. This means that, as an API user, you are abstracted
from these processes and the only thing you need to worry about is actually managing relationships between graph
resources and concepts.

To do so, you will need to interact with [vocabulary endpoints](reference.html#vocabularies-and-tags), using a specific
vocabulary called `knowledge_graph`. You can tag your resources using said vocabulary, and the tags you add will be
added as graph concepts and associated with your resources. You can read more about this process in the section
on [relationships between graph nodes and concepts](reference.html#relationships-between-graph-nodes-and-concepts). Some
concepts have been pre-loaded into the graph service, and you can use them to associate your resources with widely-used
concepts. However, you are also encouraged to create your own concepts - which, once again, is performed automatically
when managing your associations using the vocabulary endpoints.

You may come across some hierarchical concepts in the following sections, such as "ancestors", "parent concepts" or "
descendants". These were initially added with the intention of supporting hierarchy between graph concepts, but such
features were not completed. As such, it is recommended that, for now, you ignore and do not rely on any type of
hierarchy between graph concepts. This may, however, change in the future.

Lastly, a note: **none of the endpoints below are paginated.** Most of the endpoints interact with a single resource (
dataset, layer, widget, or metadata), which contributes to a healthy size for most of the Graph service endpoint
responses, as long as you keep your associations between graph resources and concepts to a reasonable amount. However,
some of the endpoints aim at retrieving full lists of, for instance, graph concepts - *please ensure that you take into
consideration the impact of using such endpoints in the performance of your applications*.

## List concepts

> Request to list concepts:

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/graph/query/list-concepts \
-H "x-api-key: <your-api-key>"
```

> Example response:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "society",
      "label": "Society",
      "synonyms": [
        "People"
      ],
      "labels": [
        "CONCEPT",
        "TOPIC"
      ],
      "numberOfDatasetsTagged": 1,
      "datasets": [
        "4458eb12-8572-45d1-bf07-d5a3ee097021"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**This endpoint does not return a paginated list - you will receive a full list of all the concepts available in the
graph. Additionally, the returned response can only be filtered by application, not searched - which means that it's
very unlikely that you will receive a reduced payload by using this endpoint. As such, you should avoid using this
specific endpoint since it might harm the performance of your application, should the graph increase significantly in
size. You can find alternative endpoints in the sections below that allow you to navigate the graph by similarity of
concepts, which is the recommended approach to navigating the graph.**

This endpoint returns the list of concepts available in the graph. If successful, the response will have status 200 OK,
containing a list of elements in the `data` index, each containing the information about one concept. Check out
the [Graph concept reference](reference.html#graph-concept-reference) for details on each of the fields of the returned
response.

This endpoint lets API users discover datasets that share concepts with the dataset with id provided in the URL path.
The difference from the endpoint above is that this endpoint also looks at the ancestor concepts from the dataset with
id provided - datasets returned might have ancestor concepts in common, but not necessarily the same exact concepts in
common.

If successful, the response will have status 200 OK, containing a list of elements in the `data` index, each containing
the id of the dataset that is related and a list of concepts that are shared. Each list item also contains
a `numberOfOcurrences` field, containing the count of common concepts. The results returned are sorted by their degree
of similarity, meaning the datasets with the higher number of shared concepts (`numberOfOcurrences`) are higher on the
list.

This endpoint lets API users discover datasets related to the lists of concepts provided. Note that, either in the GET
or POST forms for this endpoint, **concepts must be provided as a list of sets**. *AND* logical operators (`&&`) are
applied among the list of sets, while *OR* (`||`) is used for set elements. You can provide up to three sets of concepts
to search for - the example on the side exemplifies a request to this endpoint given the following sets of concepts:

- Set 1: `['spain', 'europe']`
- Set 2: `['water']`
- Set 3: `['raster', 'geospatial']`

In this specific case, the datasets returned would be related with `"spain"` OR `"europe"`, `"water"`, and `"raster"`
or `"geospatial"`. Or, expressed as a logical
condition: `("spain" || "europe") && "water" && ("raster" || "geospatial")`.

If successful, the response will have status 200 OK, containing a list of dataset ids that are related to the concepts
provided in the `data` index. Also, note that ancestor concepts are also taken into account in the search.

## Increment dataset view count

> POST request to find out which are the most viewed datasets for the token user:

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/graph/dataset/:id/visited \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
-H "x-api-key: <your-api-key>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Use this endpoint if you want to increment the view count of the dataset with id provided in the URL path. If
successful, this endpoint will return 200 OK containing an empty object in the response body.

You can optionally provide the authentication token for your API user in the request headers. If no token is provided, a
dataset view is registered without being associated with any user. If a token is provided, the dataset view count for
your API user will be incremented.

## Creating resources

**The creation of resources on the graph is performed automatically after the creation of each resource, so you don't
need to explicitly do it yourself.** Because of this, creating resources on the graph is restricted to other RW API
services, and requires authentication from a RW API service. Normal API users won't be able to call these endpoints
successfully - if you try to do it with a "normal" API user token, you will receive a response with HTTP status
code `403 Forbidden`.

For details on how these specific endpoints work, you should check out the developer docs for each of the resources
supported. The following resources are currently supported as graph nodes:

* [dataset](/developer.html#creating-dataset-graph-nodes)
* [layer](/developer.html#creating-layer-graph-nodes)
* [widget](/developer.html#creating-widget-graph-nodes)
* [metadata](/developer.html#creating-metadata-graph-nodes)

## Deleting resources

**The deletion of resources on the graph is performed automatically after the deletion of each resource, so you don't
need to explicitly do it yourself.** Because of this, deleting resources on the graph is restricted to other RW API
services, and requires authentication from a RW API service. Normal API users won't be able to call these endpoints
successfully - if you try to do it with a "normal" API user token, you will receive a response with HTTP status
code `403 Forbidden`.

For details on how these specific endpoints work, you should check out the developer docs for each of the resources
supported. The following resources are currently supported as graph nodes:

* [dataset](/developer.html#deleting-dataset-graph-nodes)
* [layer](/developer.html#deleting-layer-graph-nodes)
* [widget](/developer.html#deleting-widget-graph-nodes)
* [metadata](/developer.html#deleting-metadata-graph-nodes)

## Relationships between graph nodes and concepts

> Getting the list of concepts for a dataset:

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/graph/query/list-concepts/:id \
-H "x-api-key: <your-api-key>"
```

> Example response, containing the "urban" concept:

```json
{
  "data": [

        "label": "Cities",
        "default_parent": "settlements"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

> Getting vocabulary for the same dataset:

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/:id/vocabulary \
-H "x-api-key: <your-api-key>"
```

> Example response, containing the "knowledge_graph" vocabulary with the "urban" tag associated:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "knowledge_graph",
      "type": "vocabulary",
      "attributes": {
        "tags": [
          "urban"
        ],
        "name": "knowledge_graph",
        "application": "rw"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

> Creating (if it doesn't exist yet) the association between the vocabulary "knowledge_graph" and a dataset:

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/:id/vocabulary/knowledge_graph \
-H "x-api-key: <your-api-key>" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-token>' \
-d '{
  "application": "rw",
  "tags": ["urban", "society"]
}'
```

> Editing the association between the vocabulary "knowledge_graph" and a dataset:

```shell
curl -X PATCH https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/:id/vocabulary/knowledge_graph \
-H "x-api-key: <your-api-key>" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <your-token>' \
-d '{
  "application": "rw",
  "tags": ["urban"]
}'
```

> Deleting the association between the vocabulary "knowledge_graph" and a dataset:

```shell
curl -X DELETE https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset/:id/vocabulary/knowledge_graph \
-H "x-api-key: <your-api-key>"
```

**The management of connections between resources and concepts is handled by vocabulary endpoints, using the
vocabulary `"knowledge_graph"`.** Using this vocabulary, you can add tags to your dataset. These tags will be added as
concepts, and one (or more, accordingly) graph edges will be created, establishing a connection between your resource
and the provided tags.

This section provides some examples of how you can use vocabulary endpoints to manage your resources' concepts. Keep in
mind that you can always refer to the [vocabulary endpoint documentation](reference.html#vocabularies-and-tags) for more
details on how to use these endpoints.

On the examples on the side, you'll be able to understand that you can map the tags associated with a given resource
with the tags associated with the `"knowledge_graph"` vocabulary for the same resource. You can use vocabulary's
endpoints to create (if it doesn't exist yet), edit, or delete the tags associated with that resource. Those changes
will be reflected in the concepts that are associated with that same resource.

Lastly, keep in mind that, despite the examples on the side refer to datasets, you can use vocabulary's endpoints to
update the tags associated with the `"knowledge_graph"` vocabulary for all supported resource types: datasets, layers,
widgets, and metadata.

## Favorite relationships between graph nodes and users

As in the case of managing relationships between graph nodes and concepts, **the management of favorite relationships
between resources and users is handled by vocabulary endpoints.** Please refer to
the [favorite endpoint documentation](reference.html#favorites) for more details on how to use these endpoints.
