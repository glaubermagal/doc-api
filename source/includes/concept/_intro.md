# Resource Watch API Concepts

This section of the documentation defines the key concepts of the RW API and how they interact with each other. It's divided into three sections:

1. [Common Behaviors](#common-behaviors) details how the RW API approaches standard API behaviors like caching and pagination.

2. [Common Concepts](#common-concepts) describes several API-specific conceptual entities that are used across multiple endpoints.

3. [Core Resources](#core-resources) is a set of high-level descriptions of the key resources that the RW API manages. It's useful review the concept docs for a given resource before diving into the corresponding section in the [reference](/reference.html) documentation.
