# What is the Resource Watch API?

The RW API is a set of common back-end backend services used to power a number of geospatial data applications, including [Resource Watch](https://resourcewatch.org/), [Global Forest Watch](https://globalforestwatch.org/), and [Aqueduct](https://aqueduct.wri.org). Its capabilities include:

  - Organizing and managing datasets and their associated metadata
